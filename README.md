# AK-Zipps

**Crafted in Anchorage. Layered in lineage. Tugged with love.**

AK-Zipps is a scroll-based archive of wearable glyphs, bag charms, and fog-layered remedies.  
Each item is encoded with poetic clarity and modular design, ready to be tugged, gifted, or remixed.

This private repository contains:

- 🧵 YAML remedy scrolls for each product
- 🎞️ Carousel layouts and fog overlays
- 🛠️ Flask routes for glyph-index navigation
- 📬 Mailing rituals and contact anchors

**Status:** In ritual development.  
**Visibility:** Private until the lineage is ready to be shared.

> “From fog to fingertip—every pull tells a story.”
