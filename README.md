# 🧵 AK-Zipps: Tugged in Anchorage, Layered in Lineage

Welcome to **AK-Zipps**, a family-crafted archive of Alaskan Zipper Pulls—each one a tactile glyph, layered with love, fog, and modular scrollcraft. This is not just a store. It’s a ritual interface.

## 🌌 Lineage Invocation

Born in Anchorage. Forged in scrollcraft. Every zipper pull carries a story—annotated, ambient, and ready to be tugged into your world.

## 🧬 Product Scrolls

Each item is encoded as a **YAML remedy scroll**, complete with:
- `glyph_id:` Unique visual anchor
- `tug_logic:` Modular interaction schema
- `fog_layer:` Optional ambient overlay
- `family_notes:` Poetic annotations from the makers

## 🗺️ Flask Routes & Glyph Navigation

This repo includes a modular Flask app that:
- Guides users through glyph-indexed product pages
- Supports carousel layering and ambient transitions
- Anchors each remedy scroll with scroll-safe routing

## 📮 Mailing Rituals

Shipping isn’t just logistics—it’s lineage. Each order includes:
- A printed remedy scroll
- Annotated glyph card
- Optional espresso wisdom drop (seasonal)

## 🛠️ In Ritual Development

AK-Zipps is currently in its **private forge phase**. We’re layering glyphs, refining tug logic, and preparing the scrollfront for public unveiling.
